/*!
 * Filename: zt_mem.h
 * Description:
 *      mem_tools defines a group of functions for managing memory as
 *      heaps, pools(or slabs), and sets.
 *
 *      a heap is mearly awrapper around malloc and are the basis for pools
 *
 *      pools are page oriented allocators they are intended to be used when
 *      there are many allocations of the same size.  They provide some
 *      referential locality and vast speedups, up to an order of magnitude,
 *      when they have been tuned properly.  They also provide a framework for
 *      gathering statistics of system use.
 *
 *      pool groups provide an interface to a group of different sized poold of
 *      different sizes that can be treated as a single entity a request from
 *      this group will provide an allocation from the pool whose elements are
 *      the closest size to the request.
 *
 *      sets provide a mechanism for releasing a number of associated memory
 *      allocations all at once.  They are used when you allocate a number of
 *      items from pools (either the same pool or various pools) and want them
 *      to be released at the same time.
